# Inheritance_Classes-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study about different types of inheritance in C++

##**THEORY**:
<p>In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance" into two categories:<br>
derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class<br>
base class (parent) - the class being inherited from</p>
<p>Types of inheritance in C++:<br>
1.single inheritance-The inheritance in which a single derived class is inherited from a single base class <br>
2.multiple inheritance-A class can also be derived from more than one base class, using a comma-separated list<br>
3.multilevel inheritance-A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.<br>
4.hierarchical inheritance-the type of inheritance that has a hierarchical structure of classes. A single base class can have multiple derived classes, and other subclasses can further inherit these derived classes, forming a hierarchy of classes</p><br>
