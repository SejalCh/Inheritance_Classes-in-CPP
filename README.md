# Inheritance_Classes-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study about different types of inheritance in C++

##**THEORY**:
<p>In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:<br>

derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class<br>
base class (parent) - the class being inherited from</p>
